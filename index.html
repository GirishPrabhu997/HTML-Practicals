            <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Whole spices: 1 bay leaf, 4 cloves, 4 green cardamom, 1" cinnamon stick, 1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
            <li>4 cups water (for rice) or as needed</li>
            <li>Fresh coriander and mint, chopped (1/4–1/2 cup each)</li>
            <li>Optional: a pinch of saffron soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Step-by-step Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and soak the basmati rice for 20–30 minutes. Drain before cooking.</li>
            <li>Bring 4 cups water to a boil with 1 tsp salt and the whole spices. Add rice and cook until 70–80% done (grains should hold shape). Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil/ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan. Fry sliced onions until deep golden brown. Remove half for garnish and keep the rest in the pan.</li>
            <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and green chilies; sauté 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes; cook until they soften and oil separates.</li>
            <li>Stir in turmeric, red chili powder, biryani masala, garam masala and salt. Cook 1–2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add mixed vegetables and a splash of water; cover and cook until vegetables are partially cooked (about 5–7 minutes).</li>
            <li>Lower heat and fold in yogurt and half the chopped coriander and mint. Adjust seasoning.</li>
            <li>Layering (Dum): In the pan with vegetables, spread half the par-cooked rice, sprinkle some fried onions, herbs, and a little ghee/saffron milk. Repeat with remaining rice and toppings.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly with a lid (seal edges with dough if available) and cook on very low heat for 15–25 minutes (dum) until rice and vegetables finish cooking and flavors meld.</li>
            <li>Turn off heat and rest 10 minutes. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, mixing layers lightly.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with raita, salad, or boiled eggs (optional). Garnish with reserved fried onions and fresh herbs.</li>
